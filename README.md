### Generating Coverage Reports

This project uses the Jacoco plugin to generate test coverage reports. To generate the coverage report, run:```bash

```bash
mvn clean test
mvn jacoco:report
```

After running these commands, you can find the coverage report in the target/site/jacoco directory. Open index.html in a browser to view the coverage details, or after you run the command you can find generated reports under path [**index.html**](htmlReport/index.html)


## Running SonarQube Analysis

### Prerequisites

- SonarQube Scanner for Maven configured in your `pom.xml`.

### Configure SonarQube
- Add Correct SonarQube properties to your pom.xml in the `properties` section




### Run SonarQube Analysis and Code quality summary Reports

Execute the following Maven command to perform the analysis and send the results to the SonarQube server:

```bash
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar
```
or 
```bash
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=<your_project_key> \
  -Dsonar.projectName=<your_project_Name> \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.token=<your_project_token>
```

- clean: Cleans the project.
- verify: Runs the build lifecycle and tests.
- sonar:sonar: Runs SonarQube analysis.

### View SonarQube Reports
- Open your SonarQube dashboard at http://localhost:9000.
